								<h2 class="major">The Kuiper belt</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Region of the solar system that exists beyond the eight major planets, it is one of the largest structures in our solar system
									extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the sun. The Kuiper Belt is named for astronomer Gerard
									 Kuiper. It is a donut shaped region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. These icy bodies referred to as Kuiper belt objects
									  (KBOs) or trans- Neptunian objects (TNOs)…one of these objects Pluto planet.</p><p>
A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons—that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them—or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects
that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point (a shared center of mass) that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating
 a sort of peanut shape, creating what's known as a contact binary. Pluto, Eris, Haumea and Quaoar are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons.
There are two main groups of objects in the classical Kuiper Belt, referred to as "cold" and "hot." These terms don't refer to temperature instead, they describe
 the orbits of the objects, along with the amount of influence Neptune's gravity has had on them.</p>
 <p>
The differences between these two types of bodies in the classical Kuiper Belt have everything to do with Neptune. The cold classical KBOs have orbits that never
 come very close to Neptune, and thus they remain "cool" and unperturbed by the giant planet's gravity. Their orbits likely haven't moved much for billions of years.
  In contrast, the hot classical KBOs have had interactions with Neptune in the past (that is, with the giant planet's gravity). These interactions pumped energy
	into their orbits, which stretched them into an elliptical shape, and tilted them slightly out of the plane of the planets.
Cold classical KBOs have relatively circular orbits that are not tilted much away from the plane of the planets; hot classical KBOs have more elliptical and tilted
orbits</p><p>
The resonant KBOs are objects that complete a specific number of orbits in the same amount of time that Neptune completes a specific number of orbits
 (in other words, a ratio). There are several of these groupings, or resonances -- 1:1 (pronounced "one to one"), 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1. For example, Pluto
  is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning it circles the Sun twice for every three times Neptune goes around.
-Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants from the formation of the solar system.
-The first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was1983.</p><p>
The Kuiper belt consists of the main part of the Kuiper belt and a second region called the scattered disk.
*today the Kuiper belt is slowly eroding itself away. Objects there occasionally collide, with the collisional fragments producing smaller KBOs
(some of which may become comets) so the Kuiper belt is considered as a source of the comets, as well as dust that's blown out of the solar system
by the solar wind. The total mass of all the material in the Kuiper Belt today is estimated to be no more than about 10 percent of the mass of Earth.
-A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons-that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them-or are binary objects.</p><p>
The first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft, when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983.
 But that spacecraft didn't visit any of the icy worlds in the region—none other than Pluto had been discovered yet. (Voyager 2 visited Neptune's moon
  Triton in 1989, and Cassini visited Saturn's moon Phoebe in 2004—both could be worlds originally from the Kuiper Belt that have escaped.)
The first spacecraft to actually visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was NASA's New Horizons, which flew by Pluto and its moons in July 2015.
The Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space. We're still just beginning to explore it.

								<h2 class="major">PLUTO</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and maybe glaciers. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.
-Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a "double planet."
Today it's known as the "King of the Kuiper Belt".</p><p>
Pluto is smaller than Earth’s Moon. This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows but the snow is red.
Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 as the ninth planet from the Sun.  It is the Ninth planet orbiting the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune.
 -The International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of a dwarf planet because it did not meet the three criteria the IAU uses to define a full-sized planet. Essentially Pluto meets all the criteria except one.</p>
-Magnetosphere:-<br>
<p> It isn't known whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest little or none.
-Pluto has a surface gravity that is 1\12 of the Earth’s gravity = 0.62 m/s^2 and it is about 1/6th the size of Earth. It is actually smaller than our own Moon.
The surface consists largely of frozen nitrogen. Pluto is thought to have a rocky, silicate core surrounded by water ice.</p>
Atmospheric composition:-<br>
 <p>The thin atmosphere contains nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane, and has discrete layers of haze. The surface temperature is estimated to be about −360°F; (−218° C ;), a temperature at which most gases exist in the frozen state.<br></p>
-Chemical composition:<br>
 <p>Pluto probably consists of a mixture of 70 percent rock and 30 percent water ice (It is one third water.). Internal structure: The dwarf planet probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice, with more exotic ices such as methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen ice coating the surface.<br>
<p>This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock. Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and has several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a scattering of craters.<br>
-The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius). So Pluto has not water in liquid phase. It has Ice Mountains.</p>
<br>
<P>-Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the sun and collapses as it moves farther away—similar to a comet.<br>
Observations by New Horizons show that Pluto's atmosphere extends as far as 1,000 miles (1,600 km) above the surface of the dwarf planet.<br>
There are five moons around Pluto: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra. Charon is the closest to Pluto, and Hydra is the most distant.<br>
Charon have nearly half the size of Pluto. The huge size of Charon sometimes leads scientists to refer to Pluto and Charon as a double dwarf planet or binary system. Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours—the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation.<br></p><p>
-During its historic flyby of Pluto this past July, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft discovered towering ice mountains and vast glaciers on the frigid body. And now, flyby images recently beamed home by New Horizons reveal that the faraway dwarf planet has blue skies similar to those of Earth.<br>
-The blue color comes from complex organic molecules in Pluto's atmosphere called tholins, which are themselves probably gray or red but scatter light in blue wavelengths, New Horizons team members said. The same basic phenomenon explains why Earth's sky is blue. Pluto has 66% of the diameter of
the Earth’s moon and 18% of its mass. While it is now confirmed that Pluto is the largest dwarf planet. It has a radius of 715 miles | 1,151 kilometers.<br></p>
Pluto has an eccentric and inclined orbit. It actually gets closer to the Sun than Neptune for every 20 years out of its 248-Earth-years-long orbit.<br>
This takes it between 4.4 and 7.3 billion km from the Sun meaning Pluto is periodically closer to the Sun than Neptune.<br><p></p>
Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft.<br><p>
The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by Pluto on the 14th of July 2015 and took a series of images and other measurements.<br>

								<h2 class="major">The Journey</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/4608EUR.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>NASA’s New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto. Launched in 2006 and flying by the dwarf planet and its moons in July 2015, the interplanetary space probe sent us not just data but gorgeous images of these beautiful and distant celestial objects.
		New Horizons passed through the Jupiter system at more than 50,000 mph.</p>
	<p>	How long will you stay on Pluto?
After you reach Pluto you will stay for about 20 years there without the time of travelling. This duration is the time when Pluto becomes closer for us than Neptune so you will arrive when Pluto orbits among Uranus and Neptune.<br>
Distance: -<br>
5.8 billion KM. (this is the average distance between Pluto and the sun in the farthest position). The real distance that you will take is about 4.4 billion KM.</p>

		Classis of the journey: -<br>
		<p>VIB class: the fasted and most comfortable and expensive.
		Business class: less than VIB in the speed and the comfort but still good.</p>
		<p>First class: the same level of speed and coast of new horizons.
		Second class: the least class but good in price.
		You may ask about how you can get there….!</p><p>
		Actually, there will be two spacecrafts in the same journey: one for scientists and the other one for people who go for just fun.</p><p>
		The spacecraft of scientists will take more time than the other to make them can study the planets and the other objects in the solar system during the journey, but the spacecraft of normal people stay with no change in speed or any other thing.</p><p>
		For the nutrients during the journey, we will plant some types of algae that will save the source of food and produce the oxygen that required for the journey inside the spacecraft. So, the problem of requirements of the life during the journey had been solved.</p><p>
		When they arrive to Pluto, they will find a city in a specific area of the planet that is isolated and protected from the whole planet. There no difference between our city on Pluto and the best performance city on the earth. All the ways of comfort are available in our city like the best on the earth. This city is covered and isolated completely from the whole planet to save the best chance to survive.</p>

		Problems and solutions:- <br><p>
		The problem of food/ we will grow plants in specific farms as the soil of Pluto is icy so we can't plant anything in it without some hard conditions.</p><p>
		The problem of water/ we will save an instrument that recycle the water and filter it from any polluted and harmful objects to make it good for humans again. You won't feel deference between the water on earth and the water on Pluto.</p>
		<p>
		The problem of breathing/ the plants that we grew will save us enough oxygen for everyone on our perfect city</p>
		                                                                                  <p> <img src="images/X60_web.PNG" alt=""style="float:right;height:200px;" />
		The problem of temperature/ there is a modified suit that we are already using it on the earth to study volcanoes and the poles of the earth. These modified suits can keep the temperature of the person who wears still the normal even the climate is snowing or hot to burning. This way will keep the temperature of travelers without no change.</p><p>

		The problem of gravity/ the gravity of Pluto is too small to be regenerable so we should make a field of indusial gravity to keep the objects. If you think that is so hard, I will tell you that we are making this is the small space crafts…...what about a big city it will be easier.<br><img src="images/fffff.JPG" alt=""style="float:right;height:120px;" />
	<p>	The problem of lighting/ As Pluto is too far from its star (the sun) the amount of light that reaches there is too small to light a planet. If you give our moon 1 in brightness, you will give Pluto 1/900! ..... we will solve this problem with fluorescent sticks that light with a light when you bend it<br></p><p>

		After having the perfect journey with its events…… we will give you two options</p><p>
		To leave Pluto by the space craft that will come for you <br>
		To stay on Pluto and start your home there and be Pluto enough<br><p>
		Choose your option at the end of the journey (stay or return) and know in both……we will be one of our family and the firsts on Pluto</p>

								<p><p>Pluto is unusual planet that you can have a lot of fun on it. As you can do some activities on it such as: </p><p>
Safari: The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).
 During its historic flyby of Pluto this past July, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft discovered towering ice mountains and vast glaciers on the frigid body.</p><p>
So this factors will help people to ski on the vast glaciers. And they will enjoy the snowboarding on the mountains.
So come and do not miss the chance from your hands.</p><p>
<img src="images/E53FD590-0B1A-4DD8-8DF97A26AF718AAC_source.JPG" alt=""style="float:right;height:200px;" />
Visiting five Moons: who does not want to visit five moons instead of only one moon. Pluto has five moons those
rotate about it. Everyone has its orbit. Each moon has its own characteristics and its properties.
</p><p>
Survive Games: Most of the people today are playing these games on their mobile phones and love it so much.
These games will be available on Pluto. The game’s name is "Hurry to stay". The gamers should follow this steps:</p><p>

The gamers will be put in different areas from the planet. As they should find each other and form teams.
Every team will have their map to reach the play zone that all teams should go to.<br>
There will be small robots that you should Watch out for during your game.</p><p>
You should not go out of the area that is selected to play as this area is provided with your livelihoods.
The first team that reaches the play zone will win and the losers will come back to the Earth.</p>


Tourism:<br>
<img src="images/321_Fossa640.JPG" alt=""style="float:right;height:200px;" />

Sleipnir Fossa<br><p>
Sprawling across Pluto’s icy landscape is an unusual geological feature that resembles a giant spider. The pattern these fractures form is like nothing
else we’ve seen in the outer solar system, and shows once again that anywhere we look on Pluto, we see something different. This feature consists of at
least six extensional fractures (indicated by white arrows) converging to a point near the center. The longest fractures are aligned roughly north-south,
 and the longest of all, Sleipnir Fossa, is more than 360 miles (580 kilometers) long.</p>
Tenzing montes:<br><p><img src="images/319_Montes640.JPG" alt=""style="float:right;height:200px;" />
They are the icy mountains that reach up to 6.2 Km above Pluto…and the attractive thing for these mountains that they are the highest mountain range on
Pluto …so how it is amazing to climb the highest mountain on Pluto. It is also named after the Nepalese mountaineer Tenzing nogry. Get the courage and climb it.</p>
